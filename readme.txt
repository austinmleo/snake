SNAKE

The objective of the game is to control the 'snake' using the A S D & W 
keys and guide it to eat the 'mice'. For each mouse eaten the 'snake' 
will grow in length and the game ends when the 'snake' either bites 
itself or hits the wall.

This game is a simple exercise in the use of the linked list data structure
and dynamic memory in C++. It currently is coded for Windows machines only.
